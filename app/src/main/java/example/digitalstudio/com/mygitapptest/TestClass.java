 * Created by Omar on 15/05/2016.
 *
 * These are test classes to experiment with the use of GitHub as the VCS for the project.
 * A number of use cases will be tested to ensure no data loss...
 *
 * A number of difficult scenarios will be created to build a thorough understanding of the VCS.
 *  - plugins - use of plugins to extend the integration of AS with GitHub
 *  - .ignore file - ensuring the file is optimised for the project
 *  - Add changes / commits
 *      - project and file level
 *  - Rewind commits
 *  - Manage conflicts - add files from two different instances of AS (Android Studio)
 *  - Merge changes between the local and remote repository
 *  - Pull and Push changes from the remote / local repositories
 *  - Diff - two objects are different states; merge or mange the difference
 *         - comparing and resolving differences
 *  - Revert - rollback changes
 *  - Head - moving up / down the MASTER branch; dealing with situations of being ahead / behind on
 *           the MAster branch
 *  - Stashing  - how to use stashing
 *  - Labels how to use Labels
 *  - Branching
 *      - add branches (locally)  - push the branch to GitHub to be merged with the MASTER
 *      - merge with MASTER remote
 *      - add branches locally and remotely
 *      - life cycle branching
 *      - branching to accommodate:
 *          - lifecycle - sprints, unit tests,  integration test, acceptance test, performance test
 *                      -  PROD release, maintenance release
 *                      -  flavours - Free and Paid to accommodate variance in the code base
 *                      - Good practice for managing the aforementioned stages of the development
 *   - Need to ensure the project under version control on GitHub can be cloned and rebuilt
 *     on another version of Android Studio
 *     - Review - accept /reject code in the repository
 *   - Synchronising the local and remote repository
 *   - Patching - good practice for patching
 *   - Rebasing - to help address conflicts - create some use cases and resolve
 *   - Defect Management - logging and tracking issues on GutHub
 *   - Cloning - a repository, making changes to certain elements and pushing only those changes
 *               back to the repository for inclusion in the Master
 *   - Good practice management of the repo to avoid difficulties in versioning the artifacts
 *   - Checking and checking out of version control
 *
